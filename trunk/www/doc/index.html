<H1>Java Compiler Compiler [tm] (JavaCC [tm]) -
<br>The Java Parser Generator</H1>

<p><hr><p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<P>
Java Compiler Compiler [tm] (JavaCC [tm]) is the most popular parser
generator for use with Java [tm] applications.  A parser generator is a
tool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Java
program that can recognize matches to the grammar.  In addition to
the parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilities
related to parser generation such as tree building (via a tool
called JJTree included with JavaCC), actions,
debugging, etc. <p>

Our latest release of JavaCC is Version 4.0.
<p>

We've had hundreds of thousands of downloads and estimate serious
users in the many thousands (and maybe even tens of thousands).  Our
newsgroup <strong>comp.compilers.tools.javacc</strong> and our <a
href="mailinglist.html">mailing list</a> together have a few thousand
participants. <p>

JavaCC works with any Java VM version 1.2 or greater.  It has been
certified to be 100% Pure Java.  JavaCC has been tested on countless
different platforms without any special porting requirements.  Given
that we have seen JavaCC run on only around 5 or 6 platforms, we think
this is a great testimonial to the "Write Once Run Anywhere" aspect of
the Java programming language.  We say this as engineers who have personally experienced the
benefits of writing Java applications. <p>

<P>A <a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=110">repository of
JavaCC grammars</a> is being maintained on the JavaCC home page.  We
urge you to contribute your grammars to this repository or to the
JavaCC authors for the benefit of others.</P>
