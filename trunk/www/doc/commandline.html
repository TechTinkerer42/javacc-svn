<H1>JavaCC [tm]: Command Line Syntax</H1>

First, you can obtain a synopsis of the command line syntax by simply
typing "javacc".  This is what you get:
<P>
<PRE>
% javacc
<<< Version and copyright info>>>

Usage:
    javacc option-settings inputfile

"option-settings" is a sequence of settings separated by spaces.
Each option setting must be of one of the following forms:

    -optionname=value (e.g., -STATIC=false)
    -optionname:value (e.g., -STATIC:false)
    -optionname       (equivalent to -optionname=true.  e.g., -STATIC)
    -NOoptionname     (equivalent to -optionname=false. e.g., -NOSTATIC)

Option settings are not case-sensitive, so one can say "-nOsTaTiC" instead
of "-NOSTATIC".  Option values must be appropriate for the corresponding
option, and must be either an integer, a boolean, or a string value.

The integer valued options are:

    LOOKAHEAD              (default 1)
    CHOICE_AMBIGUITY_CHECK (default 2)
    OTHER_AMBIGUITY_CHECK  (default 1)

The boolean valued options are:

    STATIC                 (default true)
    DEBUG_PARSER           (default false)
    DEBUG_LOOKAHEAD        (default false)
    DEBUG_TOKEN_MANAGER    (default false)
    ERROR_REPORTING        (default true)
    JAVA_UNICODE_ESCAPE    (default false)
    UNICODE_INPUT          (default false)
    IGNORE_CASE            (default false)
    COMMON_TOKEN_ACTION    (default false)
    USER_TOKEN_MANAGER     (default false)
    USER_CHAR_STREAM       (default false)
    BUILD_PARSER           (default true)
    BUILD_TOKEN_MANAGER    (default true)
    TOKEN_MANAGER_USES_PARSER (default false)
    SANITY_CHECK           (default true)
    FORCE_LA_CHECK         (default false)
    CACHE_TOKENS           (default false)
    KEEP_LINE_COLUMN       (default true)

The string valued options are:

    OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       (default Current Directory)

EXAMPLE:
    javacc -STATIC=false -LOOKAHEAD:2 -debug_parser mygrammar.jj

ABOUT JavaCC:

    JavaCC is a parser generator for the Java [tm] programming
    language originally built by
    Sriram Sankar (http://www.cs.stanford.edu/~sankar) and
    Sreeni Viswanadha (http://www.cs.albany.edu/~sreeni).

<P>
The above help message pretty much explains everything.  The options are
explained in detail in
<A HREF="javaccgrm.html#prod2">the description of the JavaCC
input syntax (click here)</A>.
<P>
Any option may be set either on the command line as shown in the help message
above, or in the grammar file as describe in
<A HREF="javaccgrm.html">the JavaCC input file syntax document</A>.
The effect is exactly the same.  If the same option is set in both the
command line and the grammar file, then the option setting in the command
line takes precedence.
